OPG needs to cover costs. ID lookups will cost money, as do other elements of maintaining the service (see attached).

We know a lot of LPAs remain unused (90% from 'Use' stats). Registered and unused LPAs cover costs of small number of expensive investigations/safeguard work.

Therefore, there is an assumption that if people can check and know their LPA is valid upfront, more people will delay registration which will mean 'big ticket' subsidy costs are unmet and Registration fee explodes.

Assumption: Taking payment methods at 2 points will be worse for users than a single charge
Assumption: Conditional check - we try and get as many Donors through as possible but if they failed ID it opens a route to the Court of Protection to appeal

Outcome: Testable prototype that puts fee paying before or at Donor ID check
Test: Can we get a Donor to understand value or payment = validity of executed document at point of execution?
Test: Will a full upfront fee put people off making an LPA?
