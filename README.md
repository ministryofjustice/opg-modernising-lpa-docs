# OPG Modernising Lasting Power of Attorney Documents

Site URL: [https://docs.modernising.opg.service.justice.gov.uk](https://docs.modernising.opg.service.justice.gov.uk)

The Ministry of Justice and the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) are working on a project to modernise lasting powers of attorney (MLPA).

The project aims to:

- increase safeguards for the donor
- improve the process of making and registering an LPA for donors, attorneys and third parties
- achieve sustainability for OPG whilst keeping LPAs as affordable as possible for all people in society

The Ministry of Justice intends to launch a public consultation on changes to the legal framework for LPAs later this year.
