## Introduction

We would like to gain confidence that the user is who they say they are when using our site.

During the process, it would be a help if we knew the device they use is the same or one of many devices they use on repeat journeys.

We want to investigate the use of Browser Fingerprinting and its use in helping give the user confidence that they have been the only one accessing the site via their login and give us confidence in the devices they are using.
