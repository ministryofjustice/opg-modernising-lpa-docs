# ADRs

This section is for decisions made while building and maintaining the service.

The format of the ADRs can be found in the existing ADRs in this repo.

To add a new record, create a new markdown file prefixed with `0000-` incrementing up by one from the previous record.

Using git we can have a full version history of any amendments to ADRs already recorded.
