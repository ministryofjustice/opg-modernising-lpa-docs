## Introduction

With delayed registration, a user would have a undefined period of time between payment and registration of an LPA.

We need to investigate other services and patterns that also use this method and identify how they work.

``` test
What do we mean by payment up front? 
- Document checking model - pay up front and check validation throughout using this payment
- Click execute at that point is legit as possible
- They hold off on delaying registering it
```

## Services that have gaps in delays between payment and completion

TODO: None of these meet the need, but the top ones should be broken down anyway

* Kickstarter
* Patreon
* Gofundme

* Drivers Licence
* Passport

* Energy Companies
* Car Insurance
