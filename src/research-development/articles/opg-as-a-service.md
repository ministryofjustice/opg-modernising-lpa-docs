## Introduction

TODO: xxx% of our users on the Make an LPA Service are done by Solicitors on behalf of clients.

Citation: [Lasting Power of Attorney Statistics](https://www.lastingpowerofattorney.service.gov.uk/stats)

We need to explore a way of enabling this group of users to interact with their systems more efficiently.

We know that most solicitors firms use a small range of software providers and work with a group called the [Legal Software Suppliers Association](https://www.lssa.co.uk) (LSSA).

The companies behind this software have a keen interest in integrating with our service through code so that they can streamline their processes and automate work.

They already integrate with other government services like the Land Registry.

### Legal Software Suppliers Association (LSSA)

> The Legal Software Suppliers Association (LSSA) is the UK industry body for legal systems developers and vendors. Representing most of the leading UK suppliers, it aims to both set and maintain professional standards within the industry and manage areas of mutual interest between lawyers and software providers.

Working with the LSSA and those outside of them will be key to unlocking the full potential of any new service we create.
