## Introduction

Accessibility is one of the most important factors to be considered while building a service in Government. We build services for everyone.

This article will cover the areas within the service manual and parts that aren't.

We want to set out our intent while in our Alpha phase that we should hold ourselves too in the Beta phase of the service.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)

Reference: [Understanding WCAG 2.1](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag#wcag-design-principles)

> The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are an internationally recognised set of recommendations for improving web accessibility.

Any services created will be built to the WCAG 2.1 standard.

We will also ensure as newer versions of the standard get released that we meet these as part of our ongoing commitment to continous improvement.

We will do this by

* Adding automation to our pipelines
* Adding checks in our development environments
* Working with internal dedicated accessibility groups
* Encourage and aid team members to learn about accessibility
* Run regular accessibility audits to capture problems that cannot be caught by automated tooling
* Use our OPG accessibility tools to test our sites against popular accessibility tooling

We are already doing all of the above on our existing services and we will be learning from these implementations and using this knowledge to apply it to any new services.
